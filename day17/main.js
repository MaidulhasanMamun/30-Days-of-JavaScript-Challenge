// HTML5 Web Storage
// Web Storage(sessionStorage and localStorage) is a new HTML5 API offering important benefits over traditional cookies. Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. The data storage limit of cookies in many web browsers is about 4 KB per cookie. We Storages can store far larger data (at least 5MB) and never transferred to the server. All sites from the same or one origin can store and access the same data.

// sessionStorage
//only available within the browser tabl or window session

//We store data in the localStorage using the localStorage.setItem method.

//localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
